## Privacy Policy

This plugin ("Note to Audio Synthesizer") is developed by Your Name to synthesize audio from musical note names within the Dify platform.

### Data Collection

- The plugin **does not collect** any personal data, user identifiers, or persistent metadata.
- Input parameters (e.g., note name, duration, waveform type) are processed temporarily during invocation and are not stored.

### Data Usage

- All provided parameters are used **exclusively** to generate a synthesized audio waveform in real time.
- No user input is logged, analyzed, or repurposed beyond immediate audio synthesis.

### Data Storage

- The plugin **does not store** any user data, configuration, or generated audio files on disk or in any database.
- Audio is generated in memory and returned directly as a temporary blob within the Dify runtime environment.

### Data Sharing

- **No data is shared** with third parties, external services, or analytics platforms.
- All processing occurs locally within your Dify instance; no network requests are made outside of Dify’s execution context.

### User Responsibility

- While this plugin does not handle sensitive credentials, users should ensure that any surrounding workflows (e.g., logs, chat history) do not inadvertently expose generated audio or inputs if privacy is a concern.

### Changes to This Policy

- This privacy policy may be updated to reflect changes in functionality or compliance requirements. Users are encouraged to review it periodically.

For questions or concerns about privacy, please contact the plugin author.
